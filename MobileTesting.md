****Mobile app testing strategy****

***Strategy no: 1 Cross-Platform Testing***
There are different types of mobile OS available in the market. The main being android and iOS.
It is essential to plan to test the mobile application on all platforms to ensure the application works as expected on all platforms.
Most applications will have a separate code set for android and iOS, hence it is important to test the application cross-platform to find any issues.


***Strategy no: 2 Functionality Testing*** 
The main testing has to be related to the functionality of the application that we are developing.
The USP for any application is how well it performs the task it is intended to. So, it is very important to test to complete functionality in and out.
Every flow in the application needs to be tested to ensure there are no broken functionalities or flows.


***Strategy no: 3 Type of application***
There are mainly 3 types of mobile applications   
 		Native application – the ones developed specifically for the Android or iOS platform    
    Mobile Web application – browser-based applications on the mobile phone and   
 		Hybrid – a mix of the above two   
While planning for testing, good coverage is needed for all three types of applications to ensure stability and performance.

***Strategy no: 4 UI and UX testing*** 
The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are the next things that need to be planned well without fail.
The user interface is what the users see and how they interact with your mobile application.
The UI should be designed in a way that it is to understand and navigate through the app for all categories of users.
Similarly, for UX also the navigation between the pages and the time taken to generate the reports of output as per the application 
should be well within the pre-defined SLA.With the numerous mobile apps available in the market today, your app may not get a second chance
if the consumer or end-user does not like it.

***Strategy no: 5 Backend Testing***
Backend testing is done to ensure the data is getting stored in the right places and in the right format.
During the testing, we need to ensure that the data entered by the user is saved correctly, against the right profile, and also it should be easily retrievable.
Backend testing also involves checking the different places where the data is saved and reflected in the application and that it is done correctly.
Saving and retrieving the correct user profile would be another major use case for backend testing.

***Strategy no: 6 Network compatibility Testing***
Mobiel applications behave according to the variances in internet strength
In this case, network compatibility testing needs to be included in your test strategy as well.
This will include testing the application in different network configurations like with data and wifi.
Different signal strength, bandwidth, and then measuring the TPS (transactions per second) to see if is within the planned SLA.


***Strategy no: 7 Storage Testing***
Storage testing has become an important part of the mobile app testing strategy very recently.
With the growing number of apps being used and limited space available for use.
People tend to avoid apps that need too much space to download or more data to use.
Thus it is important to check and rectify these parameters for better acceptance from the end-users.

***Strategy no: 8 Data flow testing***
Most mobile applications are not stand-alone and need one or the other input from systems and servers outside the app.
It thus becomes an important part of the strategy to include the testing of the data flow from one system to the other.


***Strategy no: 9 Localization Testing***
While this may not be needed for all apps, if needed it would be good to have in your strategy.
Localization testing involves testing the application for location-based parameters like language, maps, and any other things related to the locations. These are sometimes legal requirements also for some locations.

***Strategy no: 10 Device Testing:*** 
There are a plethora of devices in existence now. To make sure that your app is working fine on all of them you need to check the app’s performance, functionality, and UI on real devices.
It’s a challenging as well as a daunting task. And there are thousands of devices with varied screen size out there. So in this situation depending on emulators has been seen as a common practice.
But it’s true that emulators are not an absolute solution. So the perfect solution here would be to test the app in screen size that’s commonly used and then for other options use emulators.
